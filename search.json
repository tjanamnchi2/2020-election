I used data from the nes dataset from the primer.data R package, which has data that aims to provide insights into voter behavior, current as of September 2022. Using data from the American National Election Studies (ANES), we seek to predict the relationship between voting behavior and region during the 2020 United States Presidential Election. I modeled region, a factor variable as a logistic regression model of candidate. Individuals across the United States seemed to favor Joe Biden altogether despite their region."

It has been conducted since 1948 before and after each presidential election, and combines questions about voters’ political attitudes with extensive biographical information.

Along with this, the variable pres_vote only shows the political party, so I had to manually mutate() it to show the candidate name.\nhttps://electionstudies.org\nhttps://electionstudies.org/data-center/anes-time-series-cumulative-data-file/"
