    "text": "Voters in the 2020 United States Presidential Election seemed to show different beliefs based on the region they were from. I used data from the nes dataset from the primer.data R package, which has data that aims to provide insights into voter behavior, current as of September 2022. Using data from the American National Election Studies (ANES), we seek to predict the relationship between voting behavior and region during the 2020 United States Presidential Election. I modeled region, a factor variable as a binomial logistic regression model. Individuals across the United States seemed to favor Joe Biden altogether despite their region."

    "text": "Because I had three possible outcomes, and because there is no natural ordering among the outcomes, I ended up using a categorical model.\n\\[ vote_i  \\sim Categorical(\\rho_{trump}, \\rho_{biden}, \\rho_{jorgensen}) \\]\nThe vote of person \\(i\\) takes on one of three possible values: Trump (Republican), Biden (Democrat) or Jorgensen (Third Party). The probability of each outcome is given by the respective \\(\\rho\\). And, by definition:\n\\[ \\rho_{trump} + \\rho_{biden} + \\rho_{jorgensen} = 1 \\] Since a categorical model is just a bernoulli model with more parameters, we can use the logit link function from the Bernoulli model.\n\\[\n\\rho = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0}}\n\\]\nThen I expanded the equation to have 3 separate \\(\\rho\\)s (one for each candidate) and added more \\(\\beta\\)s, one for each value of region, which we are trying to measure.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho_{biden}  &=& 1 - \\rho_{trump} - \\rho_{jorgensen}\\\\\n\\rho_{trump} &=& \\frac{e^{\\beta_{0} - \\beta_{1} northeast + \\beta_{2} south - \\beta_{3} west}}{1 + e^{\\beta_{0} - \\beta_{1} northeast + \\beta_{2} south - \\beta_{3} west}}\\\\\n\\rho_{jorgensen} &=& \\frac{e^{\\beta_{0} - \\beta_{1} northeast + \\beta_{2} south - \\beta_{3} west}}{1 + e^{\\beta_{0} - \\beta_{1} northeast + \\beta_{2} south - \\beta_{3} west}}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNow we can substitute the \\(\\beta_{}\\) values for the values found in the regression table at the bottom of the page and we get our final equation.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho_{biden}  &=& 1 - \\rho_{trump} - \\rho_{jorgensen}\\\\\n\\rho_{trump} &=& \\frac{e^{-0.22 - 0.38 northeast + 0.15 south - 0.39 west}}{1 + e^{-0.22 - 0.38 northeast + 0.15 south - 0.39 west}}\\\\\n\\rho_{jorgensen} &=& \\frac{e^{-3.4 - 0.49 northeast -0.24 south - 0.36 west}}{1 + e^{-3.4 - 0.49 northeast -0.24 south - 0.36 west}}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Now we can look at our regression table, which shows our expected values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nBeta\n95% CI\n1\n\n\n\n\nmuJorgensen_(Intercept)\n-3.4\n-3.8, -3.0\n\n\nmuTrump_(Intercept)\n-0.22\n-0.32, -0.12\n\n\nmuJorgensen_regionNortheast\n-0.49\n-1.1, 0.16\n\n\nmuJorgensen_regionSouth\n-0.24\n-0.77, 0.30\n\n\nmuJorgensen_regionWest\n-0.36\n-0.95, 0.21\n\n\nmuTrump_regionNortheast\n-0.38\n-0.54, -0.22\n\n\nmuTrump_regionSouth\n0.15\n0.02, 0.28\n\n\nmuTrump_regionWest\n-0.39\n-0.54, -0.24\n\n\n\n1\nCI = Credible Interval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe intercept is the overall value that we predict, when we look at the specific regions (muJorgensen_regionSouth), the \\(\\beta_{}\\) value for that is how much it deviates from the intercept.

It has been conducted since 1948 before and after each presidential election, and combines questions about voters’ political attitudes with extensive biographical information. Current as of September 16, 2022. I had to filtered out the year column so I could look at 2020 specifically. Along with this, the variable pres_vote only shows the political party, so I had to manually mutate() it to show the candidate name.\nhttps://electionstudies.org\nhttps://electionstudies.org/data-center/anes-time-series-cumulative-data-file/"
