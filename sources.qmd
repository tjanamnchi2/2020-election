This data was sourced from the American National Election Studies (ANES), a survey that aims to provide insights into voter behavior. It has been conducted since 1948 before and after each presidential election, and combines questions about voters' political attitudes with extensive biographical information. Current as of September 16, 2022. I had to filtered out the `year` column so I could look at 2020 specifically. Along with this, the variable `pres_vote` only shows the political party, so I had to manually `mutate()` it to show the candidate name.
