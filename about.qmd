This project seeks to predict whether someone will vote for either Trump or Biden based on their geographical location, here is a link to the [repository](https://github.com/tjanamnchi2/2020-election) on Github.

This project was created as a part of [Kaneâ€™s Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info).
